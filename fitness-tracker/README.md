## ⚡ TLDR

Analysed 30 days of Fitbit data across 33 users to understand how movement patterns affect sleep. Built a multi-page Power BI dashboard with dynamic KPI cards, custom DAX measures, and a smart alert system. Key finding: users who hit peak activity between 8am and 12pm consistently showed better sleep quality scores than those with irregular intensity patterns.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Explore how daily movement, intensity levels, and step counts correlate with sleep duration and quality, and surface actionable patterns for rest and recovery.
