# Dashboards — Customer Churn

This folder contains links and documentation for dashboards built to
summarise and communicate the key findings from the Customer Churn analysis.

The dashboards are designed to present high-level churn metrics and trends
identified through SQL and Python analysis in a format suitable for
non-technical stakeholders.

## Dashboard

### Customer Churn Overview
An interactive dashboard providing a high-level view of customer churn,
including:
- Overall churn rate
- Churn by tenure bucket
- Churn by plan type

The dashboard mirrors the core insights derived from the SQL analysis and
does not introduce additional metrics beyond those already validated.

## Purpose
The purpose of the dashboard is to:
- Make churn insights accessible to non-technical audiences
- Support data-driven discussion and decision-making
- Complement, not replace, SQL and Python analysis

The dashboard acts as a communication layer on top of the underlying
analysis rather than as a standalone analytical artefact.

---

## Notes
- Metrics displayed in the dashboard are derived from the cleaned dataset
- Visualisations are intentionally minimal to prioritise clarity
