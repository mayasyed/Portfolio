# Datasets — Customer Churn

This folder contains the datasets used in the Customer Churn analysis project.
The data is managed to clearly separate **raw source data** from **processed
analysis-ready data**.

---

## Raw Data

### `telco_customer_churn_raw.csv`
The original Telco Customer Churn dataset sourced from Kaggle.

This file is treated as **read-only** and is never modified directly.
All cleaning and transformation steps are performed programmatically in
Python to ensure reproducibility and transparency.

---

## Processed Data

### `telco_customer_churn_clean.csv`
A cleaned and standardised version of the raw dataset generated by the
`python/data_cleaning.py` script.

Key processing steps include:
- Column selection and renaming for consistency
- Data type corrections
- Handling of missing or invalid values
- Creation of analysis-ready fields used across SQL and Python workflows

---

## Data Usage
The cleaned dataset serves as the single source of truth for:
- SQL-based churn analysis and segmentation
- Python exploratory data analysis and visualisation
- Insight generation and interpretation

By separating raw and processed data, this project follows best practices
for data integrity and reproducibility.

---

## Notes
- The dataset is used as a proxy for a subscription-based business
- Any assumptions or derived fields are documented in the data cleaning code
